# 👨‍💻 Arm Assembly Codes

This was the codes made in my class of computer architecture II at college. The codes represent some famous algorithms implement in assembly, even games.

# Codes

## Binary Search 🔎

This is a famous algorithm used to find a element in an array. If the array is sorted, you can use binary search to find an element in O(log N)

## Bubble Sort 🫧

A classic sorting algorithm, but with bad complexity of O(N^2)

## Snake Game 🐍

This version of the snake game made in assembly is a simple one. There are red pixels representing the apples, so if the snake go over it her length increases in 1 pixel. But 
there are bombs too, represented by black pixels, wich can dicrease the length of the snake in 1 pixel.

## Hangman Game  𓍯😵

The classic game which you try to discover the mentioned word by its length and trying letters, until the hangman dies.

## Multiplication Table ✖️

Basically the program shows for the user the multiplication table about the number inserted as input.

## Paint 🎨

A simple version of Microsoft Paint but in assembly, with low resolution and limited features.

## Remains one 🪄

The game where you need to remain just one stick to win. Two players.

# Computer Architecture II - overview

Those classes was important to understand crucial concepts like interruptions, cache, stack and recursion, and so on. Mading the programs above made the theory be more solid 
and understandable.
